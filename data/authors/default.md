While studying Business Management in college, I certified as a Google Cloud Platform Architect & Engineer, but I wasn’t building any UX/UI and _I felt stuck..._

In 2019 I decided it was **time for a change** so I started to learn
`<JavaScript/>` whenever I had free time. I quickly started to love it and
I’ve been studying Front-End development ever since!

Over the last couple of years, I've taken _hundreds of hours_ of online courses like...

- [Full Stack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/en/) from the University of Helsinki
- [The Modern React Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-react-bootcamp/) by Colt Steele
- [Modern JavaScript From The Beginning](https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-javascript-from-the-beginning/) by Brad Traversy
- [Complete React Developer in 2021](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-react-developer-zero-to-mastery/) by Zero To Mastery
- [ES6 JavaScript: The Complete Developer's Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript-es6-tutorial/) by Stephen Grider

...and read [JavaScript: The Definitive Guide](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/javascript-the-definitive/9781491952016/) by David Flanagan.

Because we know the best way to learn is to practice, I also did a bunch of personal projects with the knowledge I gathered from the courses, you can check them out in my [portfolio](http://localhost:3000/projects). I even started a blog that focuses on the art and philosophy of coding.

```js:whatDoNow.js
const brainpower = "depends on coffee"
function proceed(brainpower) {
  return brainpower >= 0.7 ? code : eatSleepTrain)
}
```

I consider myself a ‘forever student,’ eager to both build on my
academic foundations as well as stay in touch with the latest technology and strategies.

As Socrates once said:

> The only true wisdom is in knowing you know nothing.

I always want to learn more, do more, and be more. I’m also a firm
believer that we should never settle.

I’m **hard working, super curious, passionate, committed,** and also a **fast learner**!
